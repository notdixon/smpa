Simple Multi Patch Applier
--------------------------

The Simple Multi Patch Applier is a program that allows you to apply patches to
programs in bulk, in a set order - making patches (and bugs from patches)
reproducable.

+-------------+
| 1. Building |
+-------------+
 To build SMPA, you simply need to have a C++ compiler and Make installed on
 your system, these are available in (hopefully) all Linux distributions.

  +--- Arch Based Systems -----+ +--- Debian Based Systems ------+
  |  # pacman -Syu base-devel  | | # apt install build-essential |
  +----------------------------+ +-------------------------------+
  
  +--- Fedora Linux -----------+ +--- SUSE Distributions --------+
  | # dnf install make gcc-c++ | | # zypper install make gcc-c++ |
  +----------------------------+ +-------------------------------+

 And you should have 'git' installed, the package name is the same on every
 distribution.

 Then you can simply clone the repository, and run 'make', like so:

   +--- Terminal ----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | $ git clone https://github.com/notdixon/smpa.git                            |
   | $ cd smpa                                                                   |
   | $ make                                                                      |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 If you want to install it (or uninstall it) run one of the following
   
   +--- Terminal ----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | # make install                                                              |
   | # make uninstall                                                            |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------+
| 2. Usage |
+----------+
 Using SMPA is pretty simple - simply run 'smpa' with no flags, and it will tell
 you that you can run '--help' to see them.

 To apply patches from a directory, you can use the flag `--directory', like so:
   
   +--- Terminal ----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | $ smpa --directory patches/                                                 |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Please note, that you must have a 'patch_order' file in this directory. See
 'docs/patch_order' for more information.
